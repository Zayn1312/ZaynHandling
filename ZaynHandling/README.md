ZaynHandling
Live Vehicle Handling Editor for FiveM

Start the script and open the menu in-game using the command:
/zaynhandling [handling name] (e.g. /zaynhandling zentorno)
You must be inside a vehicle to use this command. After running the command, you can also open the menu with the left Shift key.

In the editor, you can live-edit all vehicle handling values. The parameters are explained in both German and English, so even non-car developers understand what they are changing.

After adjustment, you can use the "Push to Server" button to directly upload the data to the server and automatically save it into the server files â€” no more manual copying needed.

Permissions
This script requires the command.zaynhandling permission to use. If you do not want to use a permission system, you can disable the check in the server Lua file.
